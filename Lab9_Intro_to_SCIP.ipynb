    "SCIP (Solving Constraint Integer Programs) is a high-performance solver for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), Linear Programming (LP), and Constraint Programming (CP), developed at the Zuse Institute Berlin. It combines Branch-and-Bound, cutting planes, and heuristic methods to efficiently solve large-scale optimization problems. Widely used in academia and industry, SCIP is a free and flexible alternative to commercial solvers like Gurobi and CPLEX, making it ideal for applications in supply chain optimization, scheduling, and machine learning. Through its Python API (pyscipopt), SCIP integrates seamlessly with modern computational workflows.\n",

    "In python, in order to use SCIP, you need to install the following package:\n",

    "In this example, we solve a more complex production planning problem where a factory manufactures three products (A, B, and C). Each product requires labor hours, raw materials, and machine time, and the goal is to maximize total profit while respecting the available resources. The problem is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP), where the decision variables (number of units produced) are integer values. SCIP efficiently solves the problem using Branch-and-Bound and cutting-plane methods.\n",

The solver determined that the best strategy is to produce 5 units of Product B, while producing 0 units of Products A and C. This results in a maximum profit of $25. The solution was found efficiently, with SCIP identifying the optimal result in 0.00 seconds using heuristic methods and presolving techniques, indicating a relatively simple problem structure.\n",

The choice of producing only Product B suggests that it provides the highest profit relative to its resource consumption, making it the most economical option under the given constraints."
