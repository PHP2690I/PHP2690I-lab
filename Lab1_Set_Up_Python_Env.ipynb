    "## Learn about your Terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "The terminal is a text-based interface to the system. It is a powerful tool for developers to interact with the system. You can use the terminal to run commands, install packages, and manage files. Decades ago, the terminal was the only way to interact with the computer. But now, with the development of graphical user interfaces, the terminal is not as popular as before. However, for developers, the terminal is still an essential tool. Actually, all of you have used the terminal before, but maybe you didn't realize it (I assume all of you use RStudio). That box, usually at the bottom of the RStudio, where you input command and read the output of your R scripts, is a terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "To call out the terminal in MacOS, you can use the `Command + Space` shortcut to open the Spotlight Search, and then type `Terminal` to open the terminal. This should be something look like this:\n",

    "## Install Python with Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of Python for scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment. Comparing to the standard Python distribution, Anaconda comes with a lot of pre-installed packages that could save you some time, and most importantly, **it isolates the Python environments from each other**, which means you can have different versions of Python and packages for different projects. You can definitely use the standard Python distribution, but for instructive convince, we will use Anaconda in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "But no matter which way you choose, no matter which system you are using, the logic of installation is the same. We can concisely summarize the installation process as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: Download the installer and install it.\n",
    "- Step 2: **Add the Python path to the system environment variable.** This step tells the system where to find the Python interpreter.\n",
    "- Step 3: Test if the installation is successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's take a look at the details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MacOS\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install with Homebrew\n",
    "\n",
    "[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is a package manager for MacOS. If you happen to have Homebrew installed, lucky for you, you can install Anaconda by running the following command in the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "brew install --cask anaconda\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The download and installation process will start automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install with the installer\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can download the installer from the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/download). After downloading the installer, double-click it to start the installation process. The installation process is straightforward, just follow the instructions on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Add the Anaconda path to the system environment variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that after the installation is complete, you will need to add the Anaconda path to the system environment variable. If you are using `zsh`, then you need to add the following line to the `.zshrc` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export PATH=\"/usr/local/anaconda3/bin:$PATH\"\n",
    "echo 'export PATH=/opt/homebrew/anaconda3/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc\n",
    "source ~/.zshrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using `Bash`, then you need to add the following line to the `.bash_profile` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/anaconda3/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile\n",
    "echo 'export PATH=/opt/homebrew/anaconda3/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile\n",
    "source ~/.bash_profile\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, your installation is complete. You can jump to the test section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install with the installer\n",
    "\n",
    "Please download the installer from the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/download). After downloading the installer, double-click it to start the installation process. The installation process is straightforward, just follow the instructions on the screen. You can simply click the `Next` button to proceed. But please note that you should be very clear on where you have installed Anaconda, as you will need to add the path to the system environment variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Add the Anaconda path to the system environment variable\n",
    "\n",
    "To add the Anaconda path to the system environment variable. You first need to go to the `Advanced system settings`. You can click your `Windows` button and type `Advanced system settings` to find it. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](Pics/windows-advanced-system-settings.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then click the `Environment Variables` button.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Pics/windows-environment-variables.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `System variables` section, find the `Path` variable and click the `Edit` button.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Pics/windows-path.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Click the `New` button and add the path where you installed Anaconda. For me, I installed my Anaconda at `C:\\Users\\willi\\anaconda3`, so I added this path to the system environment variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Pics/windows-add-new-path.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "After adding the path, click the `OK` button to save the changes. Then, go to your terminal and input `conda --init` to initialize the conda environment. Now, your installation is complete. You can jump to the test section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test the installation\n",
    "\n",
    "First, to check if the conda is installed correctly, you can run the following command in the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see the version number of conda, then the installation is successful. Then, you can check the version of Python by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see the version number of Python, then the installation is successful."
